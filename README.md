# Customer Segmentation
## A program that segments customers and shows a report of them.

From the inputs, customers are segmented by Current Value and Potential Value:
1. If the customer has LOW current value and LOW potential value, the program classifies it as a **Bronze Customer**;
2. If it has LOW current value and HIGH potential value it is classified as **Silver Customer**;
3. If it has a HIGH current value and LOW potential value, it is classified as a **Gold Customer**;
4. If it has HIGH current value and HIGH potential value it is classified as a **Diamond Customer**.

This program was created in order to assist the management of the customer portfolio and to be a useful tool for a sales team, also enabling a customized communication.
